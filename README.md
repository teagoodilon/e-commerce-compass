# 💻 Welcome to Odilon's E-Commerce 🛒
This is my first challenge made during the scholarship period at Compass.UOL. It is basically an e-commerce where you can add products and customers, as well as create a shopping cart and confirm orders.

## Technologies Used 
- ☕ Java 17.0.7 - [Java Archive Downloads - Java SE 17 (oracle.com)](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase/jdk17-archive-downloads.html)
- 💽 Maven 17 - [Maven – Download Apache Maven](https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi)
- 📚 Jdbc - [Download | pgJDBC (postgresql.org)](https://jdbc.postgresql.org/download/)
- 🐘 PostgreSQL - [PostgreSQL: Downloads](https://www.postgresql.org/download/)
- 👨‍💻 PgAdmin - [Download (pgadmin.org)](https://www.pgadmin.org/download/)
- 💻 Intellij - [Download IntelliJ IDEA – The Leading Java and Kotlin IDE (jetbrains.com)](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/#section=windows)


## How to run the Project 
1. Clone the project:
```
git clone https://github.com/teagoodilon/e-commerce-compass.git
```
2. Open the program PgAdmin and click in **Tools**.
3. After that, click in **Import/Export Servers...**.
4. Now select `"database.json"` in: `e-commerce-compass/src/database/database.json`
5. Then click in **Next**.
6. Check the **Checkbox**. (🤣)
7. And press **Next** two times.
8. Click **Finish** and **Ok**.
9. Connect to the server on top left side.
10. Back to the clone files.
11. Access the package: `e-commerce-compass/src/main/Main.java`
12. And run the project on Intellij IDE! ✅

## Difficulties found
One of the difficulties was correctly configuring Maven with the JDBC driver, and after that, as I reached the "middle" of the project, I realized that I should have taken the time to structure it more thoroughly right from the beginning. I didn't create the relational diagram of the tables at the start, but rather in the middle of the project because I felt the lack of this standardization.

## Express my thanks
I am extremely grateful to Compass.UOL for the great learning experience in this first challenge and all support I received. I look forward to the next ones! 😆
